    # The goal though is to allow
    #
    # * cloud with no predicate -- definitions that apply to all cloud
    #   providers. If you only use one provider ever nothing stops you from
    #   always saying `cloud`.
    # * Declarations irrelevant to other providers are acceptable and will be ignored
    # * Declarations that are wrong in the context of other providers (a `public_ip`
    #   that is not available) will presumably cause a downstream error -- it's
    #   your responsibility to overlay with provider-correct values.
    # * There are several declarations that *could* be sensibly abstracted, but
    #   are not. Rather than specifying `flavor 'm1.xlarge'`, I could ask for
    #   :ram => 15, :cores => 4 or storage => 1500 and get the cheapest machine
    #   that met or exceeded each constraint -- the default of `:price =>
    #   :smallest` would get me a t1.micro on EC2, a 256MB on
    #   Rackspace. Availability zones could also plausibly be parameterized.
    #
    # @example
    #     # these apply regardless of cloud provider
    #     cloud do
    #       # this makes sense everywhere
    #       image_name            'maverick'
    #
    #       # this is not offered by many providers, and its value is non-portable;
    #       # but if you only run in one cloud there's harm in putting it here
    #       # or overriding it.
    #       public_ip             '1.2.3.4'
    #
    #       # Implemented differently across providers but its meaning is clear
    #       security_group        :nagios
    #
    #       # This is harmless for the other clouds
    #       availability_zones   ['us-east-1d']
    #     end
    #
    #     # these only apply to ec2 launches.
    #     # `ec2` is sugar for `cloud(:ec2)`.
